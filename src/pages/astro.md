## Hello, Astro
Astro is a modern, lightweight JavaScript framework (technically a *meta-framework*) for building fast, content-focused websites.

#### Here’s the gist:

* **Primary purpose**: Create websites that load quickly and work well for blogs, marketing sites, documentation, and e-commerce storefronts.
* **Key approach**: It uses **"Islands Architecture"** — only hydrates (runs JavaScript on) the interactive parts of the page instead of the entire page.
* **Rendering style**: By default, Astro renders pages to static HTML at build time (no client-side JavaScript unless you add it).
* **Component flexibility**: You can mix and match components from different frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, and even plain HTML.
* **Performance**: Pages often have almost zero JavaScript by default, which makes them much faster than typical single-page apps.
* **Developer experience**: Simple file-based routing, Markdown/MDX support, and an intuitive syntax.

In short: Astro is like a super-efficient delivery service for your site’s HTML — it sends the bare minimum needed to load instantly, and only adds JavaScript where you explicitly want it.

Do you want me to give you a **comparison between Astro and Next.js** so you can see how it differs from other popular frameworks?
