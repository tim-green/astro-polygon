A **business inquiry** is a formal request for information from one business to another, often before starting a transaction or partnership.

It’s basically when a person or company contacts another company to:

* Ask about products or services
* Request prices or quotes
* Clarify terms, delivery times, or payment methods
* Explore potential partnerships or collaborations

Business inquiries can be:

* **General** — Asking about available services or options
* **Specific** — Requesting details for a particular order, project, or proposal

They can be sent by email, contact forms, letters, or even phone calls, but in professional contexts they’re usually written in a polite, clear format.
